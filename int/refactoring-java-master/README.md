# Refactoring Java

The code creates an information slip about movie rentals.
Rewrite and improve the code after your own liking.

Think: you are responsible for the solution, this is a solution you will have to put your name on.


## Handing in the assignment

Reason how you have been thinking and the decisions you took. 
You can hand in the result any way you feel (git patch, pull-request or ZIP-file).
Note: the Git history must be included.


## To run the test:

```
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Main
```
