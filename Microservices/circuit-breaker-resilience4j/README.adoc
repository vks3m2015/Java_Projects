This guide walks you through the process of applying circuit breakers to potentially-failing method calls using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker.

== What You Will build

You will build a microservice application that uses the http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html[Circuit Breaker pattern] to gracefully degrade functionality when a method call fails. Use of the Circuit Breaker pattern can allow a microservice to continue operating when a related service fails, preventing the failure from cascading and giving the failing service time to recover.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

:bookstore-link: https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.2&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-bookstore&name=spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-bookstore&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-bookstore&dependencies=webflux
:reading-link: https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.2&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-reading&name=spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-reading&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-reading&dependencies=webflux,cloud-resilience4j

You can use this {bookstore-link}[pre-initialized project] (for the bookstore application) or this {reading-link}[pre-initialized project] (for the reading application) and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Reactive Web* (for the service application) or *Spring Reactive Web* and *Resilience4J* (for the client application).
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Set up a Server Microservice Application

The Bookstore service has a single endpoint. It is accessible at `/recommended`, and (for simplicity) returns a recommended reading list as a `Mono` of `String`.

The main class, in `BookstoreApplication.java`, looks like this:

`bookstore/src/main/java/hello/BookstoreApplication.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/bookstore/src/main/java/hello/BookstoreApplication.java[]
----

The `@RestController` annotation marks `BookstoreApplication` as a controller class, like `@Controller` does, and also ensures that `@RequestMapping` methods in this class behave as though annotated with `@ResponseBody`. That is, the return values of `@RequestMapping` methods in this class are automatically converted appropriately from their original types and are written directly to the response body.

To run this application locally alongside a client service application, in `src/main/resources/application.properties`, set `server.port` so that the Bookstore service does not conflict with the client.

`bookstore/src/main/resources/application.properties`
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/bookstore/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

== Set up a Client Microservice Application

The Reading application is our front end to the Bookstore application. We can view our reading list there at `/to-read`, and that reading list is retrieved from the Bookstore service application.

`reading/src/main/java/hello/ReadingApplication.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
package hello;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class ReadingApplication {

	@RequestMapping("/to-read")
    public Mono<String> toRead() {
      return WebClient.builder().build()
      .get().uri("http://localhost:8090/recommended").retrieve()
      .bodyToMono(String.class);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ReadingApplication.class, args);
  }
}
----

To get the list from the bookstore, we use Spring's `WebClient` class. `WebClient` makes an HTTP GET request to the Bookstore service's URL as we provide it and then returns the result as a `Mono` of `String`. (For more information on using Spring to consume a RESTful service using `WebClient`, see the https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/[Building a Reactive RESTful Web Service] guide.)

Add the `server.port` property to `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

`reading/src/main/resources/application.properties`
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

We now can access, in a browser, the `/to-read` endpoint on our Reading application and see our reading list. However, since we rely on the Bookstore application, if anything happens to it or if the Reading application cannot access Bookstore, we have no list and our users get a nasty HTTP `500` error message.

== Apply The Circuit Breaker Pattern

Spring Cloud's Circuit Breaker library provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern:
When we wrap a method call in a circuit breaker, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker watches for failing
calls to that method and, if failures build up to a specified threshold, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker opens
the circuit so that subsequent calls automatically fail. While the circuit is open, Spring Cloud
Circuit Breaker redirects calls to the method, and they are passed on to our specified fallback
method.

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker supports many different circuit breaker implementations including,
Resilience4J, Hystrix, Sentinal, and Spring Retry. This guide uses the Resilience4J
implementation. To use this implementation, we need to add `spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j`
to our application's classpath.

`reading/pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/reading/pom.xml[]
----

`reading/build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/reading/build.gradle[]
----

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker provides an interface called `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory`, which
we can use to create new circuit breakers for our application. An implementation of this interface
is auto-configured, based on the starter that is on your application's classpath. Now we can create
a new service that uses this interface to make API calls to the Bookstore application:

`reading/src/main/java/hello/BookService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/java/hello/BookService.java[]
----

The `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` has a single method, called `create`, that we can use to create new circuit
breakers. Once we have our circuit breaker, all we have
to do is call `run`. The `run` takes a `Mono` or `Flux` and an optional
`Function`. The optional `Function` parameter acts as our fallback if anything goes wrong. In our
sample, the fallback returns a `Mono` that contains the `String` `Cloud Native Java (O'Reilly)`.

With our new service in place, we can update the code in `ReadingApplication` to use this new service:

`reading/src/main/java/hello/ReadingApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/java/hello/ReadingApplication.java[]
----


== Try It

Run both the Bookstore service and the Reading service and then open a browser to the Reading service at `localhost:8080/to-read`. You should see the complete recommended reading list:

----
Spring in Action (Manning), Cloud Native Java (O'Reilly), Learning Spring Boot (Packt)
----

Now shut down the Bookstore application. Our list source is gone, but, thanks to Hystrix and Spring Cloud Netflix, we have a reliable abbreviated list to stand in the gap. You should see:

----
Cloud Native Java (O'Reilly)
----

== Summary

Congratulations! You have developed a Spring application that uses the Circuit Breaker pattern to protect against cascading failures and to provide fallback behavior for potentially failing calls.
